# Machine-Learning-Projects

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable 
computers to improve their performance on a specific task through experience, rather than being explicitly programmed.
In other words, it's about teaching computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions based on that learning. 

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where an algorithm learns from labeled training data to make predictions or decisions without human intervention.
In supervised learning, you have a dataset with both input features and the corresponding target labels, and the goal is to learn a mapping from the inputs to the outputs.

Models used in the prjects:
1) Linear Regression
2) Multivariate Regression
3) Support Vector Machine(SVM)
4) Extreme Gradient Boosting
